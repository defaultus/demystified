# demystified
a respository that explains 'complex' functions

I plan to fill this with explanations of built in functions from a whole host of other languages (starting with python), I'm doing this because i thourougly belive the best way to learn is try try and teach. 
a play on the "the best way to learn it is to try try and explain it" and "you have not mastered something if you cannot explain it to a begginer" phrases.

# what does 'complex' mean here
this is obviously very opiniionated and is mainly the functions I myself struggled to understand when learning the language

# plans
after I am satisfied with the amount of python explanations i plan to move to a different language (like javascript) so eventually if someone is confused about any built in function of a language they could come here and have it explained to them by someone who doesn't use complex words or terminology
