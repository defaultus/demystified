back to some easy stuff

usage:
``` python
eval("2 + 4")
```

all this function does is run the code and returns the result 

this code would return 6 as a result

`eval` is is used for 
1. math
2. conditionals e.g. `5 > 3` (returns true by the way)
3. login e.g. `or`, `and`, `not`

pretty simple just as python intended 
unlike that pure brain haemorrhage of a function in 004  

function calls should not be passed into `eval` that is what `exec` is for
